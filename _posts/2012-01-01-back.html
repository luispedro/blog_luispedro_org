title: Back

<p>I'm back. I was  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmu.edu">gone</a> over five years, earned a few
letters to place after my name and, despite the friendly warnings, <a class="reference external" href="http://imm.fm.ul.pt/">I'm back</a>. I archived the old blog (which will soon reappear
online, in a new <em>archive</em> address).</p>
<p>This blog will now follow a strict schedule of an article every Sunday at 9am
(Portugal time). The articles will be more thought out than previously (where
it was often a spur of the moment, no-revision kind of deal) and they will be
available both in Portuguese and English.</p>
<p>I will also write a few restaurant reviews without schedule. Finally, the
category <em>l'Ã©cume des jours</em> is reserved for random blogging.</p>
