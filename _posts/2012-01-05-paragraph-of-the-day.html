<blockquote>
If you are a democrat you want to gerrymander districts and have an
electoral college. This vastly reduces the number of votes a president
needs to win an election.  Then tax very highly. It’s much better to decide
who gets to eat than to let the people feed themselves. If you lower taxes
people will do more work, but then people will get rewards that aren’t
coming through you. Everything good must come through you. Look at African
farm subsidies. The government buys crops at below market price by force.
This is a tax on farmers who then can’t make a profit. So, how do you
reward people? The government subsidises fertilisers and hands it back that
way.</blockquote>
