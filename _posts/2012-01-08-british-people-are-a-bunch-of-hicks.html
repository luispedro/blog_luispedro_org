title: British People Are a Bunch of Hicks
---

<p>In the EU, the British people are not really European. Every time there is a
new treaty, they never want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>They insist in the anachronistic notion of sovereignty and they even want to
read the treaties before signing them (hicks!).</p>
<p>A treaty should be signed as a symbolic act: the actual text, the obligations
that states take on, this is a subject which should not be discussed too much
between polite people. I imagine that Brits read contracts before signing in
their daily life. When they go to buy a house, they might even follow their
little-minded shop-keeper logic and simulate the payments to find out how much
they will pay.</p>
<p>Signing a mortgage is a symbolic act where we express our love for our banking
institution.</p>

</ul>
<p>At least both the nationalistic extreme-left and extreme-right are coherent.
They are against the EU and for state sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Portuguese centre is a bit more inconsistent. On Monday, it criticises the
Brits and is for the EU, but, on Tuesday, it doesn't want to fulfill any of the
obligations that it had officially take on. The Growth and Stability Pact was
optional, the agreement with the Troika is to be flexible, and the
Franco-German proposal that the UK rejected (and Portugal supported) was never
intended to be taken seriously. On Wednesday, it argues that national
sovereignty is an outdated concept for racist nacionalists, but on Thursday it
cries out that Portugal is no longer independent and posts UK Independence
Party speeches on Facebook. On Friday, it almost cries when it mentions Europe
and how much Europe means (especialy compared to the US), but on Saturday it
grumbles as it eats Spanish cabbage. On Sunday it rests, because of all this
activity is tiresome.</p>
