<p>If this were to <a class="reference external" href="http://leicontraaprecariedade.blogspot.com/p/proposta-lei-contra-precariedade.html">become law</a>
(that after 18 months a <em>temporary</em> employment contract needs to become a
permanent one), how many people would be fired after 18 months?</p>
<p>People who have more specialised jobs would probably make the transition to a
permanent position, people which are more easily replaceable would be easily
replaced.</p>
