<p>Evolution of caviar-left speech on Hugo Chavez</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Isn't it wonderful what he is doing? Your skepticism is hidden fear that he'll actually succeed and make capitalism look bad.</li>
<li>I don't support everything he's doing, of course; but overall it's a big step towards an alternative model.</li>
<li>Yes, there are bad things in his regime, but he is not a dictator (you right-wing people always use the word dictator for men of the people). He is doing some good things too. On balance good.</li>
<li>All I'm saying is that not everything is bad in Venezuela.</li>
<li>How dare you bring up Hugo Chavez? I have always denounced him as a dictator. He is not at all what I defend.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are now between 4 and 5.</p>
