title: Left or Right?
---

<p>I am not scared by either the extreme-left nor the extreme-right. Yes, they can
easily be criminal (and they are criminal, including murder). But they are not
dangerous, today, for democracy in Europe.</p>
<p>The dangerous movements are those that are difficult to say whether they are
left- or right-wing (like fascism and, especially, nazism often defied simple
categorization). I am much more scared by the Le Pen daughter who claims to be
to the left of the unions than I was about her father who was more clearly of
the right. The nationalistic left (or anti-semite left) or the nationalists who
take up leftist economic can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>The confusion w.r.t. the EU is starting to get to a point where it can brew a
movement like this. In Hungary, there is a strongly nationalistic movement who
decries neo-liberalism. In Portugal, the danger will probably appear as leftist
movements become increasingly and openly nationalistic. This is still
embrionic, but leftists should watch out over their own parties. The
nationalistic appeal is effective, but it can get out of control.</p>
