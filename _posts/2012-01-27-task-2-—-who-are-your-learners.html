title: Task 2 â€” Who are your learners
---

<p>This is Task 2 from my online course on
<a class="reference external" href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/">How to Teach Webcraft and Programming to Free-Range Students</a>
. The question is to describe who the learners are.</p>
<p>Again, my answers are focused on my
<a class="reference external" href="http://luispedro.org/projects/pfs">Programming for scientists</a> course.</p>
<p><strong>Who are my learners?</strong></p>
<p><em>Sabah</em> is a trained microbiologist who is doing pharmaceutical research. She
picked up a bit of Matlab in a two day workshop a year back and has been
writing some code to analyse her results. She is surprised at herself for
enjoying it, but does not use any version control, has no experience writing
anything longer than 100 lines of code, and, generally, her code is spaghetti
like.</p>
<p><em>Maria</em> works on material sciences for her PhD. She has been forced to learn
how to write a bit of Fortran code. She learned it back in undergraduate in a
formal university course and others in the lab have developed a big solid state
simulator library that she must use for her work. She doesn't like it very much
and it takes her a very long time to get anything done. Her advisor or
supervised recommended that she take a few more courses so that she can
improve. She is not enthusiastic, but thinks that programming is something
that, unfortunately, has become a required lab skill.</p>
<p>Naturally, I prefer the enthusiastic student, but I have seen both attitudes
and every thing in between.</p>
<p><strong>Who are not my learners?</strong></p>
<p>I also decided to list people that would probably not benefit from the course I
want to teach.</p>
<p><em>Anna</em> is a biochemist. She does not know any programming and uses Excel for
everything now. She has seen other people in the lab do simple scripts and it
seems to help them. She would like to learn. I think Anna does not have the
background for the course.</p>
<p><em>Rita</em> is a computer programmer who wants to learn Python. She is also
interested in learning about bioinformatics, so she thought that a <em>for
scientists</em> course would help. Rita could probably benefit from the first
module, where students are, in fact, taught Python, and she is welcome to sit
through those sessions. But we do not really go over any bioinformatics as such
and much of the rest of the course might be a repetitiion of what she already
knows.</p>
