<p>Are you up for reelection next year and need to look trendy? Does your company
have too much money and want to be invited to the right parties? All your
friends went to Davos and you can't even get a date on Friday?</p>
<p>Then start a startup incubator! And the <strong>Rabbit Startup Incubator Incubator</strong>
will help you do that.</p>
<div class="section" id="where-we-can-help">
<h1>Where we can help</h1>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> Learn how to say <em>we are the Y Combinator of small-town Northern
Midwest</em>. Learn how to best place young people with beards and bangs and their
Powerbooks for good photos that the press will love.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong> Learn how to get public bodies to spend taxpayer money on <em>job
creation</em>, <em>winning the future</em>, <em>building a knowledge-based economy</em>, and
other seemingly worthy goals that we'll make you look hip and virtually ensure
good press for your office at taxpayer's expense.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes</strong> Did you know that there are hundreds of semi-obscure startup
incubator rankings? We will help you win one of these. So that you can say
<em>Nowhere, Ohio, has the 12th best incubator in the sewage management business</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong> If the old mantra was <em>location, location, location</em>, with the
internet, it doesn't matter (on twitter nobody knows you're in Detroit!). But
you still need a good looking office space to feature on your home page. Our
interior designers will tell what red bean bag to buy, what lime-green couches
and cool lamps to get.</p>
<p>Our experts have started startup incubators all over the world, including one
in Jarkurghon, Uzbekistan, which is the leading startup incubator in the world
in innovation for the Potassium-based economy! We have collectively spent
billions of taxpayer money and gotten hundreds of mayor's photo ops with Bono
and other innovators.</p>
<p>So, apply now for the <strong>Rabbit Startup Incubator Incubator</strong> and you too can
have a startup incubator in your town.</p>
