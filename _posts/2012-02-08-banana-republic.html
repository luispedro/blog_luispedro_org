title: Banana Republic
---

<p>From the ongoing series <em>is this Cuba yet?</em></p>
<p>Military officers threaten the defense minister on radio and television. They
say that they see no reason to be submissive.</p>
<p>In a decent country, these gentlemen would now be out of a job.</p>
<p>What a fucking Banana Republic!</p>
