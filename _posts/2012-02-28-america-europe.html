title: America & Europe

<p>From the ongoing series <em>things I repeat all the time</em>:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/opinion/brooks-america-is-europe.html">David Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We Americans cherish our myths. One myth is that there is more social
mobility in the United States than in Europe. That's false. Another myth is
that the government is smaller here than in Europe. That's largely false,
too.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently
calculated how much each affluent country spends on social programs. When
you include both direct spending and tax expenditures, the U.S. has one of
the biggest welfare states in the world. We rank behind Sweden and ahead of
Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Canada. <strong>Social
spending in the US is far above the organization's average.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the reverse is true too: Europeans like to think that they have a
bigger social net than the US, which is not true. Some EU states do have a
better social net (not all), but it is not bigger.</p>
<p>Once you look beyond rhetoric and into policy, the US is a Northern European
economy (if anything, it's on track to being <em>less free-market</em> than Nordic
Europe as they become more free-market and the US becomes less so).</p>
