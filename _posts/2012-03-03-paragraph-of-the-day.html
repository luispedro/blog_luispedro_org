<p>Paragraph of the day:</p>
<blockquote>
A century or so ago, German sociologist Max Weber observed that Protestant
countries in northern Europe tended to outperform the Catholic and Orthodox
countries in the south of the continent. Weber believed that the
northerners had a stronger work ethic, were thriftier, and possessed more
of what is today called “social capital.” Though Weber attributed these
differences to Protestantism itself, we should note that countries did not
randomly convert to Protestantism. The roots for the cultural differences
might very well go even deeper.</blockquote>
