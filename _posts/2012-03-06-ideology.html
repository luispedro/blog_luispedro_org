<p>Reporters frequently refer to items in the Portugal/Troika Memorandum as
<em>impositions</em>, even if they were agreed to by two different Portuguese
governments after the Portuguese government asked for and received foreign aid.</p>
<p>They are impositions like a restaurant imposes that I pay my meal after I
walked in, ordered, and ate.</p>
<p>Still today, the government could refuse to take the money and the
<em>impositions</em>. It could even take the country out of the Euro.</p>
<p>Same thing goes for Greece (and, there, the government should have taken the
country out of the Euro months ago---that they continue to not do so is almost
negligent).</p>
