title: Minimal State
---

<p>From the on-going <em>Series on irony deficiency</em>:</p>
<p>An economics reporter on the radio claimed:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>This government was ideologically baring the state to its minimum.</li>
<li>As a share of the economy, the Portuguese state has never collected so much
in taxes (and it still spends more than it collects).</li>
</ol>
<p>The cognitive dissonance went unresolved.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>On a related note, recently released numbers say that absent special one-time
measures, the deficit last year was above 7.5%.</p>
<p>If this is called austerity, when the deficit is so high even if tax collection
is growing, what would qualify as fiscal stimulus?</p>
<p>(See Scott Summers on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12891">Britain's &quot;austerity&quot;</a>).</p>
