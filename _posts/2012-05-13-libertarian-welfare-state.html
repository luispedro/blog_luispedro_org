title: Libertarian Welfare State
---

<p>For the last few years, I have been thinking about something. For the last six
months, I have been working on a book about it. For the last weeks, I have
started discussing it with friends. Today, I am talking about it publicly.</p>
<p>My book will be called <em>The Libertarian Welfare State</em>. The major thesis is
explained in the following quote from Hayek:</p>
<blockquote>
There is little reason why the government should not also play some role,
or even take the intiative, in such areas as social insurance and
education, or temporarily subsidize certain experimental developments. Our
problem here is not so much the aims as the methods of government action.</blockquote>
<p>It argues that a libertarian welfare state is not only more efficient, but
<em>morally superior</em> as it treats the beneficiaries with greater respect.</p>
<p>It can be seen as a liberaltarian project, if you wish, but I rather just call
it straight libertarian. Or we can start calling Hayek and Milton Friedman
liberaltarians.</p>
<p>I will be using the twitter moniker <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/libwelfare">&#64;libwelfare</a> for this project (in case you do not
care to follow my other ramblings).</p>
<p>I have written a few pages long-hand and made several notes, but when I start
typing, this will show up on my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/luispedro/libertarian-welfare">github account</a>. Ignore this if you don't
know what github is.</p>
<p>(I know that R. Frank almost wrote a book with the same name. I think I had the
name before he did [according to google, I have references going back to 2009].
At least, I independently came up with it.  Also, I think this is a better name
for my book and <em>Darwin Economy</em> is a better book for his).</p>
