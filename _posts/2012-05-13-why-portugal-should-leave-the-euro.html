title: Why Portugal Should Leave the Euro
---

<p>and so should Greece and Ireland, but Italy and Spain can stay, along with Belgium.</p>
<p>1. Here is the evolution of NGDP in the euro zone and a few select countries
(normalized to start at 2002):</p>
<img alt="NGDP in EZ" src="/files/images/ngdp_centre.png" />
<p>We see the typical large fall in 2008 followed by a new trend line. I added a
dotted horizontal line from the 2008 value. In this environment, we should
expect that the nominal effects lose importance every day as the new growth
curve starts to assert itself.</p>
<p>Note that <em>Germany was doing worse than the rest of the EZ before 2008, **but
has been doing better since the crisis*</em>, catching up.</p>

<li>Now, look at the PIIBGS (the black line is the same as in the plot above):</li>
</ol>

<p>3. Greece is a basket-case and its statistics are all marked provisional (even
those from 10 years ago). But both Ireland and Portugal have (nominally)
stagnated since 2008. Portugal has had no nominal growth at all!</p>
<p>4. Now, while I too find the suggestion that the European Central Bank is
unable to inflate borderline ridiculous. However, it is possible that the ECB
is unable to make NGDP grow in the PIIGS without unacceptable levels of
inflation in the rest of the EZ. It is possible that, <em>even if they wanted to,
the ECB could not raise NGDP in the periphery without major negative effects in
the centre.</em></p>
<p>Banks in Germany are charging fees to have people deposit their money there.
Banks in Portugal are desperate for savers (partially because it was decided
that now was the right time to raise their reserve requirements, partially
because of capital flight).</p>
<p>5. By going back to the Escudo, the Portuguese Central Bank would be able to
inflate back the economy, the state's debt would be suddenly much more
manageable as would its large wage and pension bill (the implied debt to
current and former workers dwarfs the debt to bond holders). It could do all
the austerity it plans to do over the next five years in about five
microseconds (no exaggeration here, this is about how long it would take for
the New Escudo to devalue, taking down the value of public servant wages and
pensions). Then, growth could resume instead of this morass.</p>
<p>6. The danger is that the state would use the opportunity for a bit of state
gangsterism and take over some people's property and go all Argentina on us.
Logically, these are separate questions: whether to be gangster and whether to
remain in Euro. Ideally, capital controls should be avoided (although, really,
anybody that still has large savings in Euro in a Portuguese bank account is
asking for it). Still, if this is not done now by a reasonable government, it
will be done later by an unreasonable one.</p>
