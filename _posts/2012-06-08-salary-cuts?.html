title: Salary Cuts?
---

<p>Someone on the Right says that wages need to be cut and, predictably, the Left
goes bananas: how can people survive if their wages are cut?</p>
<p>Someone on the Left says that inflation should be higher and, predictably, the
Right goes bananas: how can people survive if their cost of living goes up?</p>
<p>It's all a joke (because terms get mixed up and nobody specifies whether they
mean real or nominal cuts) and fake outrage.</p>
