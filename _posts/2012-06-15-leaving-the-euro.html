title: Leaving the Euro
---

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What Portugal and Greece need are a more stimulative monetary policy.</li>
<li>Ideally, the European Central Bank would step up to the task.</li>
<li>Since, it does not, they are best off leaving the Euro zone and pursuing an
independent monetary policy.</li>
<li>Or they can do nothing and blame Germany for everything.</li>
</ol>
