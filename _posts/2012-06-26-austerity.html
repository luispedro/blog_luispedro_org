title: Austerity
---

<p>1. Austerity is a mood. It is the mood of sacrifice, of bourgeois ascetism. It
invokes Protestant sacrifice and a cleansing effort to redeem ourselves of sin.</p>
<p>2. Austerity is not a policy, although some policies may be said to embody
austerity.</p>
<p>3. Different policies can be austerity. The same policy can be austerity and
non-austerity.</p>
<p>4. Love of austerity is a disease of the Right, but the idea that we have
sinned economically and need sacrifice to atone appeals to the Western psyche
on a deeper level than the left-right divide (and much left-wing is Right-wing
at a deeper level).</p>

<p>This was motivated by listening to callers in <em>Forum TSF</em> (a Portuguese radio
call-in show which goes during my commute) being largely against austerity.
However, a few argued that what was needed instead were more cuts in
governmental spending (as opposed to higher taxes).</p>

<p>It seems that calling a policy a <strong>growth</strong> policy means &quot;I like this&quot; and
calling it an <strong>austerity</strong> policy means &quot;I don't like this.&quot;</p>
