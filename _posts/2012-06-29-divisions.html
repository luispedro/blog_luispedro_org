title: Divisions
---

<p>We tend to think of political divisions as left-right, but there are at least a
few other important divisions:</p>
<p>1. pundits vs politicians (which is often pundits/public opinion). Left-wing
and right-wing pundits will often agree on some issues and so will left-wing
and right-wing politicians. Except that politicians will disagree with the
pundits.</p>
<p>2. The extremes vs the centre. Look at who is saying <em>do not bailout the
banks</em>: the extreme-left and the extreme-free-market right. Which is why you
have Garett Jones approvingly quoted J. Stiglizt on <a class="reference external" href="http://mercatus.org/publication/speed-bankruptcy-firewall-future-crises">banking regulation</a>.</p>
<p>The centre is there, Very Serious People of the left and the right, bailing out
the banks. The fringes, of the left and the right, protest. The left-wingers
say how this is just an example of what is wrong with capitalism. We, on the
right, say how this is just an example of how we are becoming socialist.</p>
