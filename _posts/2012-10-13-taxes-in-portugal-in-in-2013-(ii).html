title: Taxes in Portugal in in 2013 (II)
---

<p>Following up on my <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/taxes-en/">previous post</a>, here is a graph of
what rate you pay as a function of your salary (assuming 12 months of salary).</p>
<img alt="/files/images/taxrates.png" src="/files/images/taxrates.png" />
<p>I also added a line where I add 15% VAT, assuming you are going to actually be
spending some of the money you have left (why 15%, because it is half-way
between 23% and 6%, the high and low rates of VAT).</p>
<p>Before you get outraged at these rates, do remember that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=it%27s%20not%20your%20money&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=6bd4fe01a0361f2e&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=686">it's not your money</a>.</p>
<p>The government is just generous to let you have 50% of what someone else is
willing to pay for your work because the government is very generous. If you
complain, you must be a selfish libertarian.</p>
