title: A Country for Old Men
---

<p>Using the same data <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/72-population-en">I used before</a> I now plotted the
average age of Portuguese citizens (estimated):</p>
<img alt="/files/images/76-a_age.png" src="/files/images/76-a_age.png" />
<p>Today, the average age is slightly below 40 and it will increase by about 0.2
years per year until it reaches an equilibrium at around 48. Again, I caution
that this very approximate and uses older birthrates (2005-2010).</p>
<p>Still, any talk of a revolution or big change is belied by these data. Big
changes require a young country's optimism and detachment. Old people grumble,
they do not make large changes.</p>
<p>Large scale violence is also unlikely. Very few murders are performed by 50
year olds (most of them are performed by 15-25 year old males).</p>
<p>My prediction is still that the most likely outcome is <em>nothing will happen</em>.
No big booms, no leaving the Euro (even though I think <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/11/leave-euro/">Portugal should leave
the Euro</a>), nothing, really.
Slow, bitter-sweet decline (see Argentina, last 100 years).</p>
<p>(By the way, if you're wondering, plotting the median results in the same sort
of graph, except that the median is slightly higher).</p>
