<p>On the way to work, heard an &quot;expert&quot; on the radio saying that <em>fertility has
been falling in Portugal for thirty years</em>. This is the sort of thing we hear all the time, which is why I was surprised earlier to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/72-population-en">look at the data</a> and find out it it not true.</p>
<p>Fertility in Portugal has been falling for as long as there is data.</p>
