title: Why Portugal Should Leave the Euro

<li><p class="first">Germany, Holland, and Finnland will not support the Portuguese social
welfare state indefinitely.</p>
<p>I really do not care for your arguments of why they should or should not. I
find many of them slightly absurd and betraying a lack of perspective. Why
should they not support, say, Romania, another EU member that is much
poorer than Portugal? Why does Portugal not want to support Morocco, which
is much closer, much poorer and in dire straits? Catalonia does not even
want to support the rest of Spain and you somehow expect the Germans to want
to support a corrupt Southern state?</p>
<p>In any case, it does not matter. The Northern European taxpayer will not
support the Portuguese governments' excessive spending. Deal with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Portuguese economy needs more stimulus, more money going around. A bit
more inflation to bring labour costs down. To enable some of the stickyness
to give way to new investiment and new hires.</p>
<p><strong>Wages will not go up until labour costs come down</strong>. This is the weird
paradox at the centre of this crisis. Labour costs must come down so that
they can start going up again.</p>
<p>It does not matter if they come down in nominal terms or not. If they stay
where they are, but fall in real terms (ie, there is more inflation), it's
the same thing, but much easier to achieve.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If a country's government is in debt, the thing not to do is for a large
fraction of its work force to stop working. People need to get back to work.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the huge human costs of unemployment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sure, we could do all of this with austerity. True austerity, not raising
taxes just enough to survive an extra few months. True cuts to labour
costs.</p>
<p>But Portugal is not Estonia.</p>
<p>It was not even possible to do a sleight of hand by partially shifting the
social security taxes from the employer towards the employee (which was
neutral in the long run because it did not change incidence). Only high
inflation will do it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The European Central Bank is a ridiculously conservative institution. There
was so much fear that they'd be a bunch of Southern hippies, relying on
high inflation all the time, that they over-compensated. Even the Bundesbank
used to be well more stimulative than the ECB. After all, Germany is
suffering too because of the hard money policies of the ECB. This is a
policy that caters more to Germany's prejudices than to its interests.</p>
<p>I would still prefer it, a million times, if the ECB were to change its
policies, rather than forcing the weaker states out of the Euro. The
European dialogue is poisoned. The Euro is destroying Europe. So there is
little hope for that.</p>
<p>If the ECB does not inflate, then Portugal (and Greece, and Italy, and
Spain) should leave and inflate on their own. This is the central point.</p>
<p>Outside of tax-increases, inflation has barely hit 1% in Portugal over the
last few years! We need more.</p>
