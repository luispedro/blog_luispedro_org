title: The Grand Bargain
---

<p>The <em>Grand Bargain</em> that can be struck in Europe goes something like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The European Central Bank (ECB) prints five trillion euros or so and
promises not to neutralize them.</li>
<li>The ECB gives those 5 trillion to the governments of Germany, Holland, and
Finland, and France.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. This is the grand bargain where everybody wins and which nobody
wants to take. The PIGS gain in step 1, the rest gain in step 2. Win-win.</p>
<p>The PIGS have been getting a few crums from the ECB, which the North finds
unfair (and it is completely against the treaties). So, rebalance the system by
giving them something as well.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, everybody wins from the monetary stimulus.</p>
