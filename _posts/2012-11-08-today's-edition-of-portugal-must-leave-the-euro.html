title: Today's Edition of Portugal Must Leave the Euro
---

<p>The European Central Bank <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/08/us-ecb-rates-idUSBRE8A70GZ20121108">decided today not to do anything more to stimulate the economy</a>.</p>
<p>Notice the stupidity in this reasoning: <em>Owing to high energy prices and
increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation is likely to
remain above 2 percent for the remainder of 2012</em>, therefore, we do not need to
do anything else do help.</p>
<p>Without the tax increases, inflation in Portugal has been around 1% or less for
the last few years! We need more.</p>
<p>It should have been 3 or 4 per cent. If it had been so, we might not have
needed the tax increases in the first place.</p>
