title: Tax, Overtax, and the Surtax
---

<p>At the highest tax bracket in Portugal (over 250k€ for a household), you will
be subjected to the tax (48%), the surtax (3.5%) and the overtax (5%)! (In
portuguese: a taxa, a sobretaxa e taxa extraordinária). Whatever you think of
the total rate (56%—which is after 30% of income tax, for a total of 70%),
adding all these surcharges to avoid saying the real value is stupid.</p>
<p>The radio journalist actually said <em>The number of families in this bracket is
very small and has been falling despite the recent rate increates</em>. Despite? If
the rate increases have any impact on the number of families who declare 250k€
is to make it smaller as people work less, compensate themselves differently
(in legal and illegal ways) or move to tax-friendlier regimes.</p>
<p>Most of the tax-emigration, though, I think is happening in the intermediate
brackets; households in the 100k€ brackett can almost halve their tax bill by
moving and still receive much better public services. Most tax-emigrants do not
really think themselves as tax refugees either (and might even deny it).</p>
