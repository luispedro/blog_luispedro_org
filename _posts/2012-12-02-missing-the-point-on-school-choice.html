title: Missing the Point on School Choice
---

<p>Here is a reader's comment on a recent edition of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/the-conversation/309177/">The Atlantic</a>.
The original author <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/a-national-report-card/309087/">had argued</a>
that the improved schools in New Orleans were due to the hits against the
teachers' union and reform. The reader replies</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he colorful bar graph does not provide a comparison between the public
schools and the charter schools today, but only a comparison of the schools
then and now. The public schools may in fact be better than the charters.</blockquote>
<p>This is missing the point of choice and vouchers!</p>
<p>In fact, many supporters of choice make the same mistake. The point is not that
voucher schools are better than public schools, or that privately run schools
are better than public schools in general. The point is that, <em>with choice,
every school is better</em>. If the reader is correct and the public schools in New
Orleans are now better than the charter schools (and much better than before
reform), then this is <strong>an even stronger</strong> argument for reform.</p>
<p>Most of the school choice studies make this exact mistake: they compare the
kids who attend charter schools with the kids left behind at public schools.
However, the public schools are not a good control group. They are competing to
be better in a way that they would not if the charter schools did not exist.</p>
