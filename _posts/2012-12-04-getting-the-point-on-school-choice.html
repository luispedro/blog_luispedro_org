title: Getting the Point on School Choice
---

<p>Today, on my twitter, I saw that <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ModeledBehavior">&#64;ModeledBehavior</a> had a new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2012/12/03/lessons-on-school-choice-from-sweden/">post up on Forbes</a> on school choice in Sweden. This is all based on a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifau.se/Upload/pdf/se/2012/wp12-19-Independent-schools-and-long-run-educational-outcomes.pdf">recent paper by Anders BÃ¶hlmark and
Mikael Lindahl</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Importantly, they find that the primary way that competition effects
outcomes is by improving the performance of the nearby public schools, and
not by outperforming the public schools.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>The paper is on my TOREAD list.</p>
