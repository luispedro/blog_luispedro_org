title: Two links on the EU
---

<p>1. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=18161">The Eurozone NGDP Catastrophe</a>. Moneyshot: <em>Eurozone NGDP is up
only 2.47% since [the second half of] 2008</em> Not <em>2.47% per year</em>, rather
<strong>2.47% in four years</strong>! Insanity.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the <a class="reference external" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/economic-slowdown-throughout-euro-zone-114353720.html">ECB is not even sure whether it should do something about this</a> Mmmm, inflation at around 1%, unemployment growing... Does this economy need
more stimulus or will things get out of contrl? They're not sure. Let me repeat
really slowly: inflation is, when properly measured (take out the effects of
tax raises), is around 1%, unemployment is growing without bounds. Should there
be more stimulus. They're still not sure. Who are these idiots?</p>
<p>2. The EU, overall, has had a good run lately, though. Particularly, when it
comes to the less well-off states. We should not forget that either.</p>
<p>Looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114">Eurostat data</a>,
in 1995, there were several states with a GDP per capita of half or less of the EU
average. All of them grew even if compared with 2011:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hungary: from 51% to 66%</li>
<li>Slovakia: from 47% to 73%</li>
<li>Poland: from 43% to 64%</li>
<li>Croatia: from 46% to 61%</li>
<li>Estonia: from 36% to 67%</li>
<li>Lithuania: from 35% to 66%</li>
<li>Romania: from 33% to 49%</li>
<li>Latvia: from 31% to 58%</li>
<li>Bulgaria: from 32% to 46%</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, only two states have a GDPpc less than 50% of average: Bulgaria at 46% and
Romania at 49%.</p>
<p>Yes, the wealthier nations of the Eurozone did poorly, but the success of the
poorer states needs to count for something too.</p>
<p>3. By the way, look at Ireland over the medium-term: from 103% (Italian-levels,
in 1995) to 126% just before joining the Euro, to 129% (Dutch levels, in 2011).
They fell of the pedestal (147% in 2007), but are still doing pretty OK.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Takehome message: EU good, ECB bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>The EU is great! We should have more EU.</p>
<p>The ECB is a disaster! They should be taken 'round the warehouse and made to
listen to Vogon poetry in simultaneous translation.</p>
