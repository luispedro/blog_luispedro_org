title: Austerity vs. Austerity
---

<p>1. One very weak patient walked into a hospital and was submitted to a blood
transfusion. He felt better. Another weak patient walked into a hospital and
was submitted to blood letting. He did not improve. Conclusion: medicine is
unpredictable, unlike physics: when you mess with someone's blood, you never
know what's going to happen.</p>
<p>2. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/europe/used-to-hardship-latvia-accepts-austerity-and-its-pain-eases.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> on Latvian
austerity: <em>the government laid off a third of its civil servants</em> with the
result that <em>in the second half of 2010, after less than 18 months of painful
austerity, Latviaâ€™s economy began to grow again</em> and <em>unemployment has fallen
from more than 20 percent in early 2010, but was still 14.2 percent in the
third quarter of 2012</em>. This is unlike the case in Portugal and Greece, where
austerity has also been tried and growth is lacking and unemployment is still
rising. Conclusion: economics is unpredictable, unlike physics: with austerity,
you never know what's going to happen.</p>
<p>3. Except that neither Portugal nor Greece laid off a single civil servant.
Almost all &quot;austerity&quot; in the PIGS has come from higher taxes (in Portugal,
most of the &quot;cuts&quot; to civil servant salaries are in the form of higher taxes
also borne by the private sector). The state in Portugal has increased as a
share of GDP to the highest level ever, while the Latvian state retreated and
left room for the private sector. They are radically different policies, almost
opposites. So, if they have different results, we don't need to throw our hands
up in the air and say <em>Oh, it's complicated</em>.</p>
<p>4. The NYT is right that Latvia should have devalued its currency. It should
have done so <strong>in addition</strong> to the austerity measures. The Eurozone too should
devalue its currency (the Euro). The NYT is silly in suggesting that this
option is closed to the 16 countries that form the Euro. Of course, they can
devalue. And they should, but have repeatedly chosen not to.</p>
