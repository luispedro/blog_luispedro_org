title: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Beeminder
---

<p>Below is the number of words on my draft of <em>The Libertarian Welfare State</em>,
the book I am writing on free-market-based welfare.</p>

<p>In mid-June 2012, I had a deadline as I was submitting a pitch to present the
ideas in a public setting, so I worked hard on a summary. Then, nothing. Then,
in November 2012, I start using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.beeminder.com/luispedro/goals/write">beeminder</a>. The result is obvious. If
you have not heard of Beeminder, but would like to get stuff done, check it
out.</p>
<p>My rule for beeminder is that I mark as valid any writing session of at least
5 words. As you can see, most of the time, once I break through the activating
energy, I actually write more than 5 words.</p>
<p>The book is still below 10,000 words; while I think that it will end up with
40,000 or so. But, now, I can confidently say <em>progress is being made</em>.</p>
