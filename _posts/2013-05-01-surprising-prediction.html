title: Surprising Prediction
---

<p><strong>Over the next 10 to 15 years, Europe will go through a religious revival.</strong></p>
<p>1. Demographics. This argument is simple: religiosity is hereditary (culturally
and genetically), religious people tend to have more children than the
non-religious, therefore, religion wins in the end. I think this is an
important phenomenon and it is now starting to make an impact.</p>
<p>2. Privatized religion. Religion has been privatized in Europe: while 100 years
ago, every state had its own church and was heavily involved in suppressing any
alternatives; nowadays, it is mostly a free-market. The muslim population had
an important role to play here as they were suing to be allowed to open
mosques. However, evangelicals can and do take advantage of these openings.
Privatized religion is more effective at getting converts than the state-run
monopolies: it also gives the consumer a wider choice of practices and beliefs
so that each can believe the god that suits them best.</p>
<p>3. Conversion. Most die-hard anti-religion types had a very religious
upbringing and rebelled against it (the Monty Python were all very
knowledgeable about the Christianity they mocked in Life of Brian). Their
children are rebelling by going to Sunday school (or the Madrassa). Even when
it does not go that far, it also means that that the young generation has not
grown up in an environment with constant fights about religion.</p>
<p>There is also a confusion between being anti-Catholic Church (or Church of
Sweden, or whatever the established religion was), anti-religion, or
anti-supernatural. In the past, these thinking strands would mesh together. The
rationalists would provide ammunition, the priests would be corrupt and
anti-reform. Nowadays, they break apart. After all, if your beef with religion
was that priests did not practice what they preached, then a more
fundamentalist preacher will satisfy you. And the rationalists are actually a
much smaller group than they seemed.</p>
<p>There is still a need for spirituality. There are, of course, secular sources
of spirituality. New Age quasi-religion is very widespread. The
environmentalist movement has a super-natural spiritual element at its core. It
is possible to be a non-supernatural environmentalist [I am one], but that will
often put you at odds with the environmentalist movement (the environmentalist
movement still has not come to grip with the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea#History">Urea experiment</a>).</p>
<p>And this Environmentalist New Age BS can easily be a gateway drug to religion.
It is surprisingly common to find beliefs in other irrational things like
reincarnation, predicting the future, energy flows...  Some yoga or whatnot
instructors easily make the transition to talking about harmony with the energy
of the chakras (another bit of irrationality). At some point, it really
becomes a matter of definition whether someone who believes in the
super-natural, reincarnation, and takes advice from mystics should be called
non-religious.</p>
<p>At the same time, evangelicals are gaining adherents even in the old continent.</p>
<p>4. Religion is already heavily under-represented in the public sphere. The
public sphere in Europe is still dominated by secular types and atheists, but
they are not representative of the population as a whole.</p>
<p>In the last few years, there have been religious demonstrations numbering
millions of people in European capitals (protesting against gay marriage). This
means that a change can actually come abruptly as the tabu of religion is
broken.</p>
<p>Or, in this more democratic world, it can come about from outside the
establishment (as Fox News did).</p>
<p>This is actually what I mean by religious revival: it will be again
acknowledged as part of the public discussion, instead of needing to hide
behind euphemisms.</p>
