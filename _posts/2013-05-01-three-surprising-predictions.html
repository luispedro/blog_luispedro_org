<p>I don't think all of them will become true or even that they are very likely,
but I think they are all underrated.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Over the next 10 to 15 years, Europe will go through a religious revival.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A progressive pro-life movement will emerge in the United States in the
generation that are now teenagers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Men's Rights Will be Taken Seriously Within the Decade</strong></li>
</ol>
