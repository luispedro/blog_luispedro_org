title: Rabbit Curve
---

<p>In the tradition of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer Curve</a> and the increasingly popular
<a class="reference external" href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/06/the-tabarrok-curve-in-the-wsj.html">Tabarrok Curve</a>,
I give you the <em>Rabbit Curve</em></p>
<img alt="/files/images/rabbit-curve.png" src="/files/images/rabbit-curve.png" />
<p>On the X-axis, I put the amount of individual rights vs. societal rights, and
on the Y-axis a measure of <em>goodness</em> (call it utility if you wish, but I
wanted to avoid the baggage of that word). I like this particular shape of the
curve because:</p>
<p>1. Both extremes are at zero. Neither complete anarchy (even
anarcho-capitalism) nor communism is any good.</p>
<p>2. I think most of the benefits of societal rule come very early as the basic
infrastructure is established and there is then a long decline all the way to
communism.</p>
<p>3. I think the current gradient should push us to less government. Note that
this is not true in every situation, but it is now.</p>
<p>4. Naturally, it simplifies tremendously to just have a one dimensional
variable.</p>
