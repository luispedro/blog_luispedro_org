title: Repeated Conversation
---

<p>In the last year or so I have had this conversation repeatedly with Portuguese
people. Let me abridge it for you:</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Portugal should leave the Euro.</p>
<p><strong>They</strong>: If that's a good idea, why doesn't it leave?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Because people don't want to, particularly what I'd call <em>the broad
elite</em> does not want Portugal to leave the euro.</p>
<p><strong>They</strong>: You are so naïve. <em>Power interests</em>/<em>Germany</em>/<em>The EU</em>/<em>The banks</em>
would never let Portugal leave.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: They don't have much of a say. A country can leave in five minutes if
it wants, but there is broad societal support for staying. I think it is a
wrong decision, but democraticly valid.</p>
<p><strong>They</strong>: You are very naïve if you think this is anything democratic.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Do you want Portugal to leave? Do other people you know also argue that
it should leave.</p>
<p><strong>They</strong>: No. I think it would be a disaster. Almost everyone thinks that.</p>
<p>Thus proving my point (<em>they</em> are almost invariably part of the broad elite,
that being my social class—and if you are reading this, it's probably yours
too). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I am generally receptive to a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference">revealed preferences</a> argument, but I think it
works better for individuals than for groups. Also, it reveals preferences, not
necessary what is in a group's best interest. Policy serves the prejudices of
population, with a heavy weight on the broad elite. In this case, I think those
prejudices are mostly wrong.</p>

small society such as Portugal) one or two social hops away from the
political power, who would not find it particularly odd to sit at a dinner
party next to a (current or former) minister or, if they are younger, a
journalist in an elite newspaper or an high-level advisor.</td></tr>
