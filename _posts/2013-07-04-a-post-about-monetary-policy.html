title: A Post About Monetary Policy

<p>A government is worried about whether it is possible to do road work.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: We can't possibly do it. Cars are on the road all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: Well, we close the road.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: We post signs saying that the road is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: But how will that stop people from just driving through the signs?</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: People will respect them. We can have a couple of police officers to warn off anybody who wants to got through.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: A couple of police officers? Hundreds of people go by per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: A couple should be enough. If anybody really tries to go through, they'll get a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: You don't understand. Hundreds of people go by per hour. To give a ticket to all of them would require hundreds, thousands of policemen.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: Most people would see the sign and drive around it. You'd also announce it so that people know the road is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: Is this one of those <em>expectation channel</em> arguments?</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: Well, yes, if you'd like.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: I don't trust expectation channels. I think we need at least a thousand police officers to get the cars off the road.</p>
<p><strong>Aid to Minister of Public Works</strong>: Maybe more if the cars do not run and need to be carried off.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: What? No. The cars should run just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: You have too much faith in the <em>invisible legs</em> of cars.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: They are not invisible legs. You post a sign, say that you will ticket anybody who dares cross it, and most likely, you won't even ticket anybody. People will just drive around!</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: No tickets?</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: Well, maybe, one or two. But ideally, yes, no tickets. Everybody would just see the sign and drive around.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: You have a lot of faith in the expectation channel. But the <em>let's do nothing and let the invisible legs do the work</em> approach does not work. We tried that before.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: We wanted to have no misparked cars in the city, but people keep parking wrongly even though we had a TV Public Service Announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: Did you give them any tickets?</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: No, of course not! The voters actually hate getting tickets. They love the idea of regulated parking, but hate tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: So, of course your policy failed.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: You just previously said that <em>it's just about announcing a policy and it will work</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Market-Roadster</strong>: If you mean to follow through, the citizens do most of the work: they will drive around, they will park correctly, but you need to follow through.</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Public Works</strong>: You just said earlier, we wouldn't give many tickets in the closed road. So, the expectations channel sometimes work and sometimes doesn't! My point, exactly: you can't trust the invisible legs.</p>
