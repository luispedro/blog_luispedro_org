I'm back. I was  `gone <http://www.cmu.edu>`__ over five years, earned a few
letters to place after my name and, despite the friendly warnings, `I'm back
<http://imm.fm.ul.pt/>`__. I archived the old blog (which will soon reappear
online, in a new *archive* address).

This blog will now follow a strict schedule of an article every Sunday at 9am
(Portugal time). The articles will be more thought out than previously (where
it was often a spur of the moment, no-revision kind of deal) and they will be
available both in Portuguese and English.

I will also write a few restaurant reviews without schedule. Finally, the
category *l'écume des jours* is reserved for random blogging.
