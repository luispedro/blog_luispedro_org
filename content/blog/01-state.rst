There are several states: there is the welfare state, the minimal state, and
there is the state we're in.[*]_

I was gone for five years, I'm back, and I expected that the heralded
libertarian revolution would have taken place. I expected that the bridge that
links Lisbon to Almada would have been renamed *Bridge João Miranda*. Instead,
it's still *25 of April* and, in government, we won a D (the old party in power
was the left-wing PS, now we have the centrist PSD). It's not a lot of
progress.

Portugal, excuse my Portuguese, is in deep shit. So far, austerity measures
were just a warm-up act and, in 2012, things will start to hurt. Since 2000,
there has been almost no economic growth and I see no reasons to believe that
things will change in the next few years.

A few months ago, some news paper (or was it a TV station) asked, in one of
those throw-away man-of-street questionaires: *do you think that the crisis
will last two more years?* My friends, countrymen: two years would be a dream
scenario. It can last another 20 or another 40 years. We have 10 years of
stagnation, a whole generation without a job. Why not another 10 or 20? The
demographic situation is bad and will not get better.

The best case scenario is reforms now and, by 2016 or so, Portugal would grow
enough that we would be back to the golden year of 2007 (remember how great
that was? Neither do I). This is best-case scenario, if the right reforms are
made now.

Will the right reforms be made? Probably not. This is a democracy. In a
democracy, you get the government you deserve. The PS-led governments, for
years gave the country exactly what it promised and what it was elected to do
(as Henrique Raposo says, they weren't swindlers, just socialists). *They did
not lose those elections because the electorate finally got fed up with the
waste of money.  They lost because they run out of money to waste.* (In Lady
Thatcher's `words <http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/thatcher.asp>`__ the
socialists ran out of other people's money.) Currently there is, in some
leftist circles, talk of a Citizen's Audit to the Debt. Well, that already took
place. It was during the 2009 elections, where the growing debt and its
sustainability dominated the debate. The debt won.

The supposed "austerity" of this government may seem a lot, but except for a
few extraordinary measures (raiding private pension funds, selling assets),
`deficit is still 8% of GDP
<http://sol.sapo.pt/inicio/Economia/Interior.aspx?content_id=36159>`__.  This
is not even close. Even if the government completely defaults on its debt, how
is it going to pay for its primary deficit? Prayer?

Even if the party with a D won, which is called a right-wing party in Portugal,
this is still one of the most left-wing countries in Europe, economically
speaking (`Heritage <http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking>`_ places it almost
at the bottom, just above Greece and Italy—great examples, those). Again, this
is a democray. The Portuguese elites are on the left, the politicians give them
what they want.

And, on the left, the solution is always the same: let the rich pay. As it so
happens, the rich they tager are now very well-organised into a polity called
Germany. And these rich people don't want to pay for Portuguese
public-servants. Really, they don't.
