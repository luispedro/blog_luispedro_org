Recently, a Portuguese holding company moved its capital to Holand. In fact,
out of the 20 companies that are part of the PSI-20 stock market index (the
largest companies on the Lisbon stock exchange), 19 have some sort of foreign
(often Holand or Luxembourg) operation for tax purposes.

One of the comments that comes up is that *everything is going to have to be
paid by the workers who cannot move their tax residency to Holand*.

In fact, it is an economics 101 fact that taxes are paid by those who have the
least alternative (this is called, the incidence of the tax). This is why it is
so hard to tax capital. Capital is mobile; the worker/consumer not so much.

Eppur, si muove. The worker/consumer can change their tax liabilities to Holand
too. It might not be as easy, but it is simple: he just needs to move there.

Portugal is still a country from which you emmigrate, and the majority of
emmigrants still leave to go work in construction sites in Luxembourg or
Holand. But there are also qualified emigrants who go to Holand or Luxembourg
to work in investment banking; to the UK or Estonia to develop software; or to
the US to lead a marketing effort. Of course, these people leave for all sorts
of idiosyncratic reasons: because of a personal contact, an opportunity that
popped up, a sense of adventure, or a passion for New York City. However, they
also go for the simple reason that they make more money outside of Portugal.
And a lot of that difference, at those incomes that are considered high in
Portugal (but are still middle-class elsewhere) is fiscal.

The Economist reported recently that Portugal is the country where taxes are
highest for those earning 100k USD (75k EUR). If you then consider the quality
(or lack thereof) of public services, then there isn't much doubt: in Portugal,
if you earn about that amount of money (or even half of that, as the Portuguese
government will already tax you as high-income after your first 40k EUR), then you
pay too much for little return.

How many of the Portuguese professionals from good schools that work today in
Holland are not, they too, fiscal exiles?
