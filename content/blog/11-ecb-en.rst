Today, a slightly more technical post.

Whose fault is this? As Tyler Cowen says, when you start telling stories, your
IQ drops 10 points. The crisis had several midwifes.

The portuguese government is very much at fault. It spent too much for too
long. It reached the crisis obese. The European Central Bank is also very much
at fault. It has been following an ultra-conservative policy, which has broken
the PIGS legs. *But the obese patient, who on top of that smokes, cannot claim
that were it not for the broken leg, it would be training for the marathon.*
Just go back a few years, and the Portuguese economy wasn't doing so well
either. Still, without assigning it all of the blame, we can say that the ECB
doesn't help.

Unfortunately, I feel that the question of whether Germany (and the other
Northern countries) should transfer resources to the PIGS has been confounded
with the monetary question. The German voter is against transfers and they have
mainly been made behind the scenes (if the voters only understood how much the
Bundesbank has been lending the PIGS). Just sitting here saying that *the
Germans should pick up the tab* is really no solution.

The monetary question is different. Transfers and money intersect, but are
separate questions. In Europe, in the political centre, there is no true
monetary thought, except for the Germans who are against monetary policy. As
Matt Yglesias pointed out, this is an area where the European centre is the
American Republican Party (Axel Weber could do well in the Republican debates).

The ECB should expand much more. If banks are not lending (in technical terms,
the velocity of money has fallen), print more money. This is a central bank
that raised interest rates last summer. It brought them back down, but still.
This is a central bank whose pride is in having been to the right of the
ultra-conservative Bundesbank.

As the two questions are confounded, influential Northern politicians will be
against this idea. Moreover, the ECB has been acting in way as to transfer
resources to the PIGS. The solution is simple: **the ECB should buy more
Bunds!** And Finish, and Dutch bonds.

The Northern governments would get their debts reduced, leading to an increase
in inflation there. For the PIGS, this would be similar to devaluing their
currency.

As Laffer says: there are free lunches and we need to find them and eat them.
