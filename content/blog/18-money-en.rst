From the ongoing series *there is no monetary thinking in Europe*:

People want the Euro to be more competitive. I agree. Unfortunately, people
(sometimes the same person, in the same conversation) also want it to be a
strong currency. But they are opposites! There are only three possibilities:

1. The euro is priced just about right.
2. The euro is too expensive and needs to be more competitive.
3. The euro is too cheap and needs to be stronger.

Options 2 and 3 are mutually exclusive! You have to decide whether you want to
argue for one or the other.

I would argue for 2. The European Central Bank is way too conservative (and the
bias is pro-hard-money rather than pro-Germany; even when it hurt Germany, the
ECB kept the Euro strong). The Euro needs to be weaker.

The ECB has
`kept NGDP growth too slow <http://uneasymoney.com/2011/11/27/what-are-they-thinking/>`__.

The political discourse in Portugal, more than in most places, suffers from the
delusion that *there are no trade-offs.* We can have a competitive strong
currency, we can have a dynamic economy with strong labour laws, we can spend
our way out of trouble.
