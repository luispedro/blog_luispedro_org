Portugal is Madeira's Germany.

The central government is being asked to bail the regional government out of
its mispending, its bungling of the budget, its lies (including at least
allegedly crimes, but, it's Portugal so nobody cares about such "procedural"
issues).

Alberto João Jardim, Madeira's elected-for-life President, is often laughed at
by Lisbon's elite. But, at least the left-wing Bloco de Esquerda (BE) should
look at the man more carefully. He behaves with respect to the mainland exactly
as they argue that the Portuguese government should behave with respect to the
EU.

Everytime I see or read about Alberto João, I cannot help but smile. Here's
how Alberto João is BE's model prime-minister:

1. Everything is the outside's fault (mainland/Troika)
2. They don't respect the sovereignty of Madeira/Portugal
3. If you don't give me more money to mispend/invest in the economy, I will threaten to leave the Union (with mainland, EU)
4. `Or I won't pay the government debt <http://www.dn.pt/especiais/interior.aspx?content_id=2255473&especial=Revistas%20de%20Imprensa&seccao=TV%20e%20MEDIA>`__
5. I do it for the people
