Two great articles on modern manufacturing:

- `Making it in America <http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/8844/>`__
- `How the US lost out on iPhone work <http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1>`__

I do find it a bit grating that none of the articles found a need to address
the underlying moral question of why we should accept policies that make the
$13/hour American worker better off and hurt the $2/hr Chinese worker. At
$13/hr, you are in the `top 10% <http://www.globalrichlist.com/>`__ worldwide.

(Note to Portuguese readers: we often have an anti-China speech imported from
the US or France, but Portugal is much closer to $2 than to $13 for unskilled
labour).
