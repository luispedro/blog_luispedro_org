   :alt: Free Milk

Some evil religious organisation has been giving milk to poor people.

Don't they know that it's `illegal <http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/asae-apreende-leite-no-pingo-doce-e-no-continente_135832.html>`__ (Portuguese supermarkets were fined for selling milk too cheaply)? Someone should stop this!
