Evolution of caviar-left speech on Hugo Chavez

1. Isn't it wonderful what he is doing? Your skepticism is hidden fear that he'll actually succeed and make capitalism look bad.
2. I don't support everything he's doing, of course; but overall it's a big step towards an alternative model.
3. Yes, there are bad things in his regime, but he is not a dictator (you right-wing people always use the word dictator for men of the people). He is doing some good things too. On balance good.
4. All I'm saying is that not everything is bad in Venezuela.
5. How dare you bring up Hugo Chavez? I have always denounced him as a dictator. He is not at all what I defend.

We are now between 4 and 5.
