     Using data from a national survey, it is shown that intelligence tends to be
     positively related to the probabilities of having tried alcohol, marijuana,
     cocaine and several other recreational drugs. Evidence is also presented that
     those relationships typically disappear or change sign at high levels of
     intelligence.
