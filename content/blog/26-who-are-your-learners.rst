This is Task 2 from my line course on `How to Teach Webcraft and Programming to Free-Range Students <http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/>`__
. The question is to describe who the learners are.

Again, my answers are focused on my `Programming for scientists <http://luispedro.org/projects/pfs>`__ course. 

**Who are my learners?**

*Sabah* is a trained microbiologist who is doing pharmaceutical research. She
picked up a bit of Matlab in a two day workshop a year back and has been
writing some code to analyse her results. She is surprised at herself for
enjoying it, but does not use any version control, has no experience writing
anything longer than 100 lines, and, generally, her code is spaghetti like.

*Maria* works on material sciences for her PhD. She has been forced to learn
how to write a bit of Fortran code. She learned it back in undergraduate in a
formal university course and others in the lab have developed a big solid state
simulator. She doesn't like it very much and it takes her a very long time to
get anything done. Her advisor or supervised recommended that she take a few
more courses so that she can improve. She is not enthusiastic, but thinks that
programming is something that, unfortunately, has become a required lab skill.

Naturally, I prefer the enthusiastic student, but I have seen both attitudes
and every thing in between.

**Who are not my learners?**

I also decided to list people that would probably not benefit from the course I
want to teach.

*Anna* is a biochemist. She does not know any programming and uses Excel for
everything now. She has seen other people in the lab do simple scripts and it
seems to help them. She would like to learn. I think Anna does not have the
background for the course.

*Rita* is a computer programmer who wants to learn Python. She is also
interested in learning about bioinformatics, so she thought that a *for
scientists* course would help. Rita could probably benefit from the first
module, where students are, in fact, thought Python, and she is welcome to do
that. But we do not really go over any bioinformatics as such and much of the
rest of the course might be repetitions for her.
