Paragraph of the day:

    A century or so ago, German sociologist Max Weber observed that Protestant
    countries in northern Europe tended to outperform the Catholic and Orthodox
    countries in the south of the continent. Weber believed that the
    northerners had a stronger work ethic, were thriftier, and possessed more
    of what is today called “social capital.” Though Weber attributed these
    differences to Protestantism itself, we should note that countries did not
    randomly convert to Protestantism. The roots for the cultural differences
    might very well go even deeper.
