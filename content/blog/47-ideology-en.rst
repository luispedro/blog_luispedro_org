Reporters frequently refer to items in the Portugal/Troika Memorandum as
*impositions*, even if they were agreed to by two different Portuguese
governments after the Portuguese government asked for and received foreign aid.

They are impositions like a restaurant imposes that I pay my meal after I
walked in, ordered, and ate.

Still today, the government could refuse to take the money and the
*impositions*. It could even take the country out of the Euro.

Same thing goes for Greece (and, there, the government should have taken the
country out of the Euro months ago---that they continue to not do so is almost
negligent).
