In Portugal, the courts don't work very well.

Unfortunately, this often leads to a strong impulse to throw away rule of law
provisions. Today, I heard the President of the Supreme Court argue that people
should wait for the result of their appeals in jail. Now, I read that the government wants `people who are arrested to lose social benefits <http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/presos-preventivos-vao-perder-direito-ao-rendimento-social-de-insercao-1540233>`__ even before they are found guilty of a crime.
