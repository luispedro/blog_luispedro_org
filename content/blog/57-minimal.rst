From the on-going *Series on irony deficiency*:

An economics reporter on the radio claimed:

1. This government was ideologically baring the state to its minimum.
2. As a share of the economy, the Portuguese state has never collected so much
   in taxes (and it still spends more than it collects).

The cognitive dissonance went unresolved.

*

On a related note, recently released numbers say that absent special one-time
measures, the deficit last year was above 7.5%.

If this is called austerity, when the deficit is so high even if tax collection
is growing, what would qualify as fiscal stimulus?
