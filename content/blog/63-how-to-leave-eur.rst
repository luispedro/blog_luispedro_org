How to Leave the Euro in a Few Easy Steps:

1) At 18.00 on a Friday evening, announce that (a) the New Escudo will be legal
tender for all contracts in Portugal and (b) all existing contracts are now
converted at the rate of 1 Euro = 100 NE (New Escudos). All bank withdrawals at
ATMs will be suspended while new notes can be distributed, but the automatic
payment system will start working in New Escudos in less than 24 hours.

It is the conversion of contracts which is the most important step. If bank
accounts were kept in Euro, everything would work just fine too, but I expect
that the government will actually want some of those Euros for itself. So
expect your bank account to now contain New Escudos.

After this, we are almost done.

2) Print money and mint coins as fast as you can and start giving them out at
ATMs. I expect this to take a few weeks to fully normalise, but small amounts
should be available for withdrawal by Monday (some printing/minting could be
done ahead of time). Withdrawals would still be limited due to limited
availability of notes and coins, but Portuguese people use electronic payments
a lot and they would be working. A limit of 2,000 NE (equivalent to 20 Euro)
per day would allow for small cash payments (drug dealers and other users of
large cash transactions would be able to continue to operate in Euro).

3) Set up special courts to deal with the fall-outs. Almost all contracts are
clearly under Portuguese Law and would be converted to NEs, so no questions
there. It is only international contracts that would need sorting out. Of
those, a large fraction could simply be renegotiated (it doesn't matter at what
value they were set by the government, as they would be ripped apart).

Only a few would actually need a court decision. For those, make decisions as
fast as possible in a way that is generally well-accepted by all (even if they
are not happy). For this, one would need, at least, the acquiescence of the EU
powers-that-be.

None of this is covered by any EU treaty or international law. But, hey, it's
the EU, who cares about legality? (Unless by legal you mean *what Germany wants
or can be guilted into paying for*, which is the legal standard that has
traditionally been used in EU matters).

That's it.

Of course, by 18.01 on Friday evening, the NE would be trading at 1 Euro = 150
NEs or so, which is the point. It's 5 years of austerity in 5 microseconds.

The New Portuguese Central Bank can now allow more inflation and keep NGDP
growing stably.

Money is mostly about coordination. Switching the currency is a major
discoordination event. However, if it is done well, and there is a proper
expectation that the system will henceforth be stable, then the one-time price
that is paid would be worth it to get away from the ECB straight-jacket.

On the other hand, it might actually reduce uncertainty. Right now, nobody is
sure of who (and most importantly, when) will leave the single currency. By
settling this question, coordination might actually improve.
