Whatever government wins in Greece will either (1) take the country out of the
Euro or (2) stay. They will also do a bunch of other unimportant things on the
labour market, regulation, etc.

If they choose option 1, the country will have a little economic boom and they
will reap the credit from all the unimportant things. It they choose option 2,
the quagmire will continue and it will just go to show that all the unimportant
things were wrong.
