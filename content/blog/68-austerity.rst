1. Austerity is a mood. It is the mood of sacrifice, of bourgeois ascetism. It
invokes Protestant sacrifice and a cleansing effort to redeem ourselves of sin.

2. Austerity is not a policy, although some policies may be said to embody
austerity.

3. Different policies can be austerity. The same policy can be austerity and
non-austerity.

4. Love of austerity is a disease of the Right, but the idea that we have
sinned economically and need sacrifice to atone appeals to the Western psyche
on a deeper level than the left-right divide (and much left-wing is Right-wing
at a deeper level).

This was motivated by listening to callers in *Forum TSF* (a Portuguese radio
call-in show which goes during my commute) being largely against austerity.
However, a few argued that what was needed instead were more cuts in
governmental spending (as opposed to higher taxes).

It seems that calling a policy a **growth** policy means "I like this" and
calling it an **austerity** policy means "I don't like this."
