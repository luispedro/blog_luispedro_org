These are spread around Lisbon. They are from the `Movement for a Socialistic
Alternative <http://www.mas.org.pt>`__.

I laugh every time I see one. It lists a few "crimes": BPN (a bank which was
bailed out after it was found out that previous management had been
fraudulent), some public-private partnerships, the expensive submarines that
the navy bought, and, finally, the funny part: Madeira's debt.

You see, Madeira is an island and half, which are part of Portugal, but have a
good amount of autonomy. Lately, it turned out that through semi-legal
chicanery, the local government had accumulated a fairly large debt and wanted
the central government to bail them out.

Now, a lot of people in Portugal are unhappy about this. The funny part is the
total lack of perspective. A similar *Bewegung f√ºr eine Sozialistische
Alternative*, the German version of this leftist movement could very well list
*Debt of Portugal* in its list of complaints against the right-wing German
government! In fact, they would even be more right to complain about bailing
Portugal out: it's not the same country, they are not a government above the
Portuguese government, and they signed a bunch of agreements where Portugal
promised never to ask for a bailout.

(As for the BPN, I will just make the same comment I made wrt `Bankia
<http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/5/bankia/>`__. Bailing out banks or any other
industry is socialism for the well-connected [is there any other kind], not the
free-market. In the free-market, their investors would have lost their money,
not been bailed out by daddy state).
