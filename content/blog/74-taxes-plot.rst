Following up on my `previous post <http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/taxes-en/>`__, here is a graph of
what rate you pay as a function of your salary (assuming 12 months of salary).

I also added a line where I add 15% VAT, assuming you are going to actually be
spending some of the money you have left (why 15%, because it is half-way
between 23% and 6%, the high and low rates of VAT).

Before you get outraged at these rates, do remember that `it's not your money

The government is just generous to let you have 50% of what someone else is
willing to pay for your work because the government is very generous. If you
complain, you must be a selfish libertarian.
