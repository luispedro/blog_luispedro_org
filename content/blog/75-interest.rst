How much of Portuguese tax-payer money will go to interest payments in 2013?

Zero.

Yes, that's right: **zero**, or **almost zero**. The interest payments to both
private and public creditors will be paid by the Troika and the taxes collected
will be spent on everything else. So, defaulting on the debt would allow the
government to spend zero extra euros on anything else. In fact, if there is any
slippage in tax collection or over-spending, then the Troika will actually be
paying both the whole of interest plus an additional sum for other costs. After
all, the initial promise was for an almost-balanced primary budget (excluding
interest payments) in 2012. That didn't happen.

If the Troika leaves or is kicked out, then, even assuming no bad effects from
the political fall out, there is no extra money to spend next year. There also
would not be any alternative to really strict austerity: with any euro needing
to come into the state budget for every euro spent.

Or, of course, **Portugal can leave the euro** which makes it both easier for
the state to pay its promises (both debt and salaries) and allows room for real
growth (aggregate demand is too low).

Or, but this is really getting crazy now, the European Central Bank could not
be run by ultra-conservatives and start providing the stimulus that Europe
needs. Even `Germany needs stimulus
<http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=17164>`__. It's been a harmful confusion
that a conservative monetary policy is good for Germany just because Germany
wants it. It sets up the discussion as a battle for spoils. It's not so good
for Germany (it is just less damaging). There is a true win-win here: ECB
provides stimulus and it helps everybody.
