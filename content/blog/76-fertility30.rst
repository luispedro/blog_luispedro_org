On the way to work, heard an "expert" on the radio saying that *fertility has
been falling in Portugal for thirty years*. This is the sort of thing we hear all the time, which is why I was surprised earlier to `look at the data <http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/72-population-en>`__ and find out it it not true.

Fertility in Portugal has been falling for as long as there is data.
