Using the same data `I used before
<http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/10/72-population-en>`__ I now plotted the
average age of Portuguese citizens (estimated):

Today, the average age is slightly below 40 and it will increase by about 0.2
years per year until it reaches an equilibrium at around 48. Again, I caution
that this very approximate and uses older birthrates (2005-2010).

Still, any talk of a revolution or big change is belied by these data. Big
changes require a young country's optimism and detachment. Old people grumble,
they do not make large changes.

Large scale violence is also unlikely. Very few murders are performed by 50
year olds (most of them are performed by 15-25 year old males).

My prediction is still that the most likely outcome is *nothing will happen*.
No big booms, no leaving the Euro (even though I think `Portugal should leave
the Euro <http://blog.luispedro.org/2012/11/leave-euro/>`__), nothing, really.
Slow, bitter-sweet decline (see Argentina, last 100 years).

(By the way, if you're wondering, median results in the same sort of graph,
except that the median is slightly higher).
