1.  Unemployment is at 16%
    
2.  Unemployment is at 16%
    
3.  Germany, Holland, and Finnland will not support the Portuguese social
    welfare state indefinitely.
    
    I really do not care for your arguments of why they should or should not. I
    find many of them slightly absurd and betraying a lack of perspective. Why
    should they not support, say, Romania, another EU member that is much
    poorer than Portugal? Why does Portugal not want to support Morocco, which
    is much closer, much poorer and in dire straits? Catalonia does not even
    want to support the rest of Spain and you somehow expect the Germans to want
    to support a corrupt Southern state?
    
    In any case, it does not matter. The Northern European taxpayer will not
    support the Portuguese governments' excessive spending. Deal with it.
    
4.  The Portuguese economy needs more stimulus, more money going around. A bit
    more inflation to bring labour costs down. To enable some of the stickyness
    to give way to new investiment and new hires.
    
    **Wages will not go up until labour costs come down**. This is the weird
    paradox at the centre of this crisis. Labour costs must come down so that
    they can start going up again.

    It does not matter if they come down in nominal terms or not. If they stay
    where they are, but fall in real terms (ie, there is more inflation), it's
    the same thing, but much easier to achieve.

5.  If a country's government is in debt, the thing not to do is for a large
    fraction of its work force to stop working. People need to get back to work.

    This is in addition to the huge human costs of unemployment.

6.  Sure, we could do all of this with austerity. True austerity, not raising
    taxes just enough to survive an extra few months. True cuts to labour
    costs.
    
    But Portugal is not Estonia.

    It was not even possible to do a sleight of hand by partially shifting the
    social security taxes from the employer towards the employee (which was
    neutral in the long run because it did not change incidence). Only high
    inflation will do it.

7.  The European Central Bank is a ridiculously conservative institution. There
    was so much fear that they'd be a bunch of Southern hippies, relying on
    high inflation all the time, that they over-compensated. Even the Bundesbank
    used to be well more stimulative than the ECB. After all, Germany is
    suffering too because of the hard money policies of the ECB. This is a
    policy that caters more to German's prejudices than to its interests.
    
    I would still prefer it, a million times, if the ECB were to change its
    policies, rather than forcing the weaker states out of the Euro. The
    European dialogue is poisoned. The Euro is destroying Europe. So there is
    little hope for that.

    If the ECB does not inflate, then Portugal (and Greece, and Italy, and
    Spain) should leave and inflate on their own. This is the central point.

    Outside of tax-increases, inflation has barely hit 1% in Portugal over the
    last few years! We need more.
    
8.  Did I mention that unemployment is at 16%?
