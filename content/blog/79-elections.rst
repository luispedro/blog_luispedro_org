1.  Big elections do not matter as much we give them credit for, small
    elections matter more than we think. (This is a general principle of mine
    for life: *the big does not matter as much as the small*).

    In particular, the result of the Presidential election in the US today has
    less importance than the combined result of many more state-level and local
    elections.

    I agree with `Scott Sumner on the senate elections: <http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=14545>`__:

        I endorse Scott Brown [Republican for Senate in MA] and Joe Donnelly
        [Democrat for Senate in IN] (or Andrew Horning [Libertarian for Senate
        in IN]).  The GOP needs to be punished for replacing respected Senators
        like Richard Lugar with complete morons like Mourdock.  Fix the GOP by
        electing people like Brown and rejecting people like Mourdock.

2.  Notice that I did not write that the Presidential election does not matter.
    Only that the result does not as much. The election was important.

    By the time this election takes place (today) both candidates have
    converged on very similar positions. The important question is *what are
    these positions?*

    Of course, many of these positions are pure electioneering, and the
    candidates will do none of that. But not all and which issues moved the
    polls and the donations will be taken into account (at least until the next
    election cycle).
    
    But, for policy sake, it matters more where the centre is than who actually
    wins todays weighted coin toss.

3.  Tyler Cowen had a post linking to `reports of people donating to both Obama and Romney <http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/the-myth-of-the-rational-donor-model-this.html>`__. I commented there and will comment here too:

    If you care about policy (rather than purely partisan politics), this might
    actually be much more effective than donating to a single candidate.

    If I donated 1 million to Rs every time Mitt Romney lays off the Southern
    conservatism on social issues and 1 million to Ds every time Obama went to
    the centre on economics; then I’d be moving both candidates in my
    direction.

    (If you don’t have 1 million, go Kantian and say “I will do what I wished
    millions of other would do” and donate $100).

    If you always donate to your candidate in the same amount, you will have no
    impact on what his policies, only on whether he wins. If you want change,
    you’re better off trying to move the centre of discussion and not caring so
    much about who wins.
