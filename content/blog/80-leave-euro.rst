The European Central Bank `decided today not to do anything more to stimulate the economy <http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/08/us-ecb-rates-idUSBRE8A70GZ20121108>`__.

Notice the stupidity in this reasoning: *Owing to high energy prices and
increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation is likely to
remain above 2 percent for the remainder of 2012*, therefore, we do not need to
do anything else do help.

Without the tax increases, inflation in Portugal has been around 1% or less for
the last few years! We need more.

It should have been 3 or 4 per cent. If it had been so, we might not have
needed the tax increases in the first place.
