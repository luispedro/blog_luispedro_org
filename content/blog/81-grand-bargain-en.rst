The *Grand Bargain* that can be struck in Europe goes something like this:

1.  The European Central Bank (ECB) prints five trillion euros or so and
    promises not to neutralize them.
2.  The ECB gives those 5 trillion to the governments of Germany, Holland, and
    Finland, and France.

That's it. This is the grand bargain where everybody wins and which nobody
wants to take. The PIGS gain in step 1, the rest gain in step 2. Win-win.

The PIGS have been getting a few crums from the ECB, which the North finds
unfair (and it is completely against the treaties). So, rebalance the system by
giving them something as well.

In the meanwhile, everybody wins from the monetary stimulus.
