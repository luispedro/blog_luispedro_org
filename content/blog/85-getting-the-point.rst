Today, on my twitter, I saw that `@ModeledBehavior <https://twitter.com/ModeledBehavior>`__ had a new `post up on Forbes <http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2012/12/03/lessons-on-school-choice-from-sweden/>`__ on school choice in Sweden. This is all based on a `recent paper by Anders BÃ¶hlmark and 
Mikael Lindahl <http://www.ifau.se/Upload/pdf/se/2012/wp12-19-Independent-schools-and-long-run-educational-outcomes.pdf>`__:

    Importantly, they find that the primary way that competition effects
    outcomes is by improving the performance of the nearby public schools, and
    not by outperforming the public schools.

Exactly!

The paper is on my TOREAD list.
