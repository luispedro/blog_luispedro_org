1. `The Eurozone NGDP Catastrophe
<http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=18161>`__. Moneyshot: *Eurozone NGDP is up
only 2.47% since [the second half of] 2008* Not *2.47% per year*, rather
**2.47% in four years**! Insanity.

In the meanwhile, the `ECB is not even sure whether it should do something about this <http://finance.yahoo.com/news/economic-slowdown-throughout-euro-zone-114353720.html>`__ Mmmm, inflation at around 1%, unemployment growing... Does this economy need
more stimulus or will things get out of contrl? They're not sure. Let me repeat
really slowly: inflation is, when properly measured (take out the effects of
tax raises), is around 1%, unemployment is growing without bounds. Should there
be more stimulus. They're still not sure. Who are these idiots?

2. The EU, overall, has had a good run lately, though. Particularly, when it
comes to the less well-off states. We should not forget that either.

Looking at `Eurostat data
<http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tec00114>`__,
in 1995, there were several states with a GDP per capita of half or less of the EU
average. All of them grew even if compared with 2011:

- Hungary: from 51% to 66%
- Slovakia: from 47% to 73%
- Poland: from 43% to 64%
- Croatia: from 46% to 61%
- Estonia: from 36% to 67%
- Lithuania: from 35% to 66%
- Romania: from 33% to 49%
- Latvia: from 31% to 58%
- Bulgaria: from 32% to 46%

Now, only two states have a GDPpc less than 50% of average: Bulgaria at 46% and
Romania at 49%.

Yes, the wealthier nations of the Eurozone did poorly, but the success of the
poorer states needs to count for something too.

3. By the way, look at Ireland over the medium-term: from 103% (Italian-levels,
in 1995) to 126% just before joining the Euro, to 129% (Dutch levels, in 2011).
They fell of the pedestal (147% in 2007), but are still doing pretty OK.

4. Takehome message: EU good, ECB bad.

The EU is great! We should have more EU.

The ECB is a disaster! They should be taken 'round the warehouse and made to
listen to Vogon poetry in simultaneous translation.
