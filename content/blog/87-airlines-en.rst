I wrote previously that *it is sometimes easier to understand Portugal as a
very successful third-world country than a poorly working first-world one*.

Today the Portuguese government backed down on the idea of privatizing the
state-owned airline, TAP. The official statement mentioned technical doubts on
the financial structure, but there had been a strong campaign against it,
including a strong campaign by Publico, the main Portuguese daily newspaper.

From `Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier#List_of_flag-carrying_airlines>`__
we can retrieve a list of countries which still have a fully, or almost fully
(>90%), state-owned airline:

- Afghanistan
- Algeria
- Angola	
- Argentina	
- Armenia
