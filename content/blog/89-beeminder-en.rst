Below is the number of words on my draft of *The Libertarian Welfare State*,
the book I am writing on free-market-based welfare.

In mid-June 2012, I had a deadline as I was submitting a pitch to present the
ideas in a public setting, so I worked hard on a summary. Then, nothing. Then,
in November 2012, I start using `beeminder
<https://www.beeminder.com/luispedro/goals/write>`__. The result is obvious. If
you have not heard of Beeminder, but would like to get stuff done, check it
out.

My rule for beeminder is that I mark as valid any writing session of at least
5 words. As you can see, most of the time, once I break through the activating
energy, I actually write more than 5 words.

The book is still below 10,000 words; while I think that it will end up with
40,000 or so. But, now, I can confidently say *progress is being made*.
