A government is worried about whether it is possible to do road work.

**Minister of Public Works**: We can't possibly do it. Cars are on the road all the time.

**Market-Roadster**: Well, we close the road.

**Minister of Public Works**: How?

**Market-Roadster**: We post signs saying that the road is closed.

**Minister of Public Works**: But how will that stop people from just driving through the signs?

**Market-Roadster**: People will respect them. We can have a couple of police officers to warn off anybody who wants to got through.

**Minister of Public Works**: A couple of police officers? Hundreds of people go by per hour.

**Market-Roadster**: A couple should be enough. If anybody really tries to go through, they'll get a ticket.

**Minister of Public Works**: You don't understand. Hundreds of people go by per hour. To give a ticket to all of them would require hundreds, thousands of policemen.

**Market-Roadster**: Most people would see the sign and drive around it. You'd also announce it so that people know the road is closed.

**Minister of Public Works**: Is this one of those *expectation channel* arguments?

**Market-Roadster**: Well, yes, if you'd like.

**Minister of Public Works**: I don't trust expectation channels. I think we need at least a thousand police officers to get the cars off the road.

**Aid to Minister of Public Works**: Maybe more if the cars do not run and need to be carried off.

**Market-Roadster**: What? No. The cars should run just fine.

**Minister of Public Works**: You have too much faith in the *invisible legs* of cars.

**Market-Roadster**: They are not invisible legs. You post a sign, say that you will ticket anybody who dares cross it, and most likely, you won't even ticket anybody. People will just drive around!

**Minister of Public Works**: No tickets?

**Market-Roadster**: Well, maybe, one or two. But ideally, yes, no tickets. Everybody would just see the sign and drive around.

**Minister of Public Works**: You have a lot of faith in the expectation channel. But the *let's do nothing and let the invisible legs do the work* approach does not work. We tried that before.

**Market-Roadster**: When?

**Minister of Public Works**: We wanted to have no misparked cars in the city, but people keep parking wrongly even though we had a TV Public Service Announcement.

**Market-Roadster**: Did you give them any tickets?

**Minister of Public Works**: No, of course not! The voters actually hate getting tickets. They love the idea of regulated parking, but hate tickets.

**Market-Roadster**: So, of course your policy failed.

**Minister of Public Works**: You just previously said that *it's just about announcing a policy and it will work*!

**Market-Roadster**: If you mean to follow through, the citizens do most of the work: they will drive around, they will park correctly, but you need to follow through.

**Minister of Public Works**: You just said earlier, we wouldn't give many tickets in the closed road. So, the expectations channel sometimes work and sometimes doesn't! My point, exactly: you can't trust the invisible legs.
