If this were to `become law
<http://leicontraaprecariedade.blogspot.com/p/proposta-lei-contra-precariedade.html>`__
(that after 18 months a *temporary* employment contract needs to become a
permanent one), how many people would be fired after 18 months?

People who have more specialised jobs would probably make the transition to a
permanent position, people which are more easily replaceable would be easily
replaced.
