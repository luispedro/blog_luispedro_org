In the tradition of the `Laffer Curve
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve>`__ and the increasingly popular
`Tabarrok Curve
<http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/06/the-tabarrok-curve-in-the-wsj.html>`__,
I give you the *Rabbit Curve*

On the X-axis, I put the amount of individual rights vs. societal rights, and
on the Y-axis a measure of *goodness* (call it utility if you wish, but I
wanted to avoid the baggage of that word). I like this particular shape of the
curve because:

1. Both extremes are at zero. Neither complete anarchy (even
anarcho-capitalism) nor communism is any good.

2. I think most of the benefits of societal rule come very early as the basic
infrastructure is established and there is then a long decline all the way to
communism.

3. I think the current gradient should push us to less government. Note that
this is not true in every situation, but it is now.

4. Naturally, it simplifies tremendously to just have a one dimensional
variable.
