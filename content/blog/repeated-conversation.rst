In the last year or so I have had this conversation repeatedly with Portuguese
people. Let me abridge it for you:

**Me**: Portugal should leave the Euro.

**They**: If that's a good idea, why doesn't it leave?

**Me**: Because people don't want to, particularly what I'd call *the broad
elite* does not want Portugal to leave the euro.

**They**: You are so naïve. *Power interests*/*Germany*/*The EU*/*The banks*
would never let Portugal leave.

**Me**: They don't have much of a say. A country can leave in five minutes if
it wants, but there is broad societal support for staying. I think it is a
wrong decision, but democraticly valid.

**They**: You are very naïve if you think this is anything democratic.

**Me**: Do you want Portugal to leave? Do other people you know also argue that
it should leave.

**They**: No. I think it would be a disaster. Almost everyone thinks that.

Thus proving my point (*they* are almost invariably part of the broad elite,
that being my social class—and if you are reading this, it's probably yours
too). [#]_

I am generally receptive to a `revealed preferences
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference>`__ argument, but I think it
works better for individuals than for groups. Also, it reveals preferences, not
necessary what is in a group's best interest. Policy serves the prejudices of
population, with a heavy weight on the broad elite. In this case, I think those
prejudices are mostly wrong.

.. [#] I call the "broad elite" the top 10%, the sort of people who are (in a
   small society such as Portugal) one or two social hops away from the
   political power, who would not find it particularly odd to sit at a dinner
   party next to a (current or former) minister or, if they are younger, a
   journalist in an elite newspaper or an high-level advisor.
