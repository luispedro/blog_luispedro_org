**A progressive pro-life movement will emerge in the United States in the
generation that are now teenagers**

This one is easy:

1. There is little logical relationship between being a progressive and being
pro-choice, unless you just define progressive as pro-choice. The link between
thinking that labour unions are good idea and that a foetus is not a life with
rights is purely incidental.

There is a perceived link in that progressives tend to be pro-women and there
is an idea that pro-choice is pro-women. This is fine as abstract argument, but
fails to describe reality: that women tend to be (just barely) more pro-life
than men.

2. The historical relationship between progressivism and pro-choice politics is
very recent. In the US, it dates from the 1980s, and in South America you can
find pro-life progressives.

3. The young in the US are more progressive, but more pro-life as well. There
is bound to be an overlap between these two groups.

Notice that I am not predicting that the whole progressive movement will become
pro-life, not even a majority, but a significant minority. If you think this is
hedging too much, let me predict that a radically pro-choice candidate like
Obama will become impossible and that you'll see one primary contender in the
democratic party that is both very progressive and pro-life (even if she does
not win the nomination).

4. The progressive movement is now accepting of fairly extreme pro-maternity
opinions. If you've had a child in the elites in the last few years, you will
know that the progressive opinion is at least accepting of attachment parenting
(I think this understates my case).

The idea that a mother should sacrifice her interests for those of her child is
accepted and celebrated. It is even argued, in progressive circles no less,
that the woman should sacrifice her interests without any benefits for the
child in order to demonstrate that she really cares (foregoing pain relief
during labour would be a prime example of this attitude).

The mommy wars perhaps started as Christian stay-at-home-moms versus
progressive working-mothers, but they are no longer broken along these lines.
These are progressive civil wars in mommyland.

5. The progressive spirit finds its more natural expression in fighting for
change rather than in standing against it. This is doubly true if the change
being fought for is put in moral terms about the protection of the weak. It
thrives on exposing what really goes on in hidden corners of our society, which
the establishment have chosen to not discuss.

I think I do not need to spell out how the pro-life movement can be couched in
the terms above. I can imagine an expos√© of the abortion industry being
marketed as *this century's `The Jungle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle>`__*.

(I'm neither a progressive nor pro-life, by the way.)
