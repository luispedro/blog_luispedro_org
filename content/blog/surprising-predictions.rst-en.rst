The context of the three posts above was a question by Elidorado on twitter:

I gave three answers.

I don't think all of them will become true or even that they are very likely,
but I think they are all underrated.

1.  **Over the next 10 to 15 years, Europe will go through a religious revival.**
2.  **A progressive pro-life movement will emerge in the United States in the
    generation that are now teenagers**
3.  **Men's Rights Will be Taken Seriously Within the Decade**
